```r
require(quanteda)
```


```r
toks <- tokens(data_char_ukimmig2010)
```

There are several multi-word expressions that are important in social scientific reserach.


```r
multi_kw <- kwic(toks, phrase(c('asylum seeker*', 'british citizen*')))
head(multi_kw, 10)
```

```

To preserve these expressions in bag-of-word analysis, you have to compound them using `tokens_compound()`.


```r
comp_toks <- tokens_compound(toks, phrase(c('asylum seeker*', 'british citizen*')))
compu_kw <- kwic(comp_toks, c('asylum_seeker*', 'british_citizen*'))
head(compu_kw, 10)
```

```
##                                                                           
##         [BNP, 1724]        the honour and benefit of | British_citizenship
##         [BNP, 1957] all illegal immigrants and bogus |   asylum_seekers   
##         [BNP, 2157]            region concerned. An' |    asylum_seeker   
##         [BNP, 2189]          country. Because every' |    asylum_seeker

You can discover muti-words expressions in your tokens using `textstat_collocations()`. See [Compunding multi-word expressions](../../../advanced-operations/compound-mutiword-expressions/) to learn how to do it.
