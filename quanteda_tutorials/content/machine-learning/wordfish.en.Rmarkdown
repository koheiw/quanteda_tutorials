Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions (Slapin and Proksch 2008). Wordfish also allows for scaling documents, but compared to Wordscores reference scores/texts are not required. Wordfish is an unsupervised one-dimensional text scaling method, meaning that it estimates the positions of documents solely based on the observed word frequencies. 

```{r message=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
```

In this example, we show how to apply Wordfish to the Irish budget speeches from 2010. First, we create `dfm`, afterwards we run Wordfish.

```{r}
irish_dfm <- dfm(data_corpus_irishbudget2010, remove_punct = TRUE)
wf <- textmodel_wordfish(irish_dfm, dir = c(6,5))
summary(wf)
```

We can plot the results of a fitted scaling model using `textplot_scale1d()`.

```{r}
# create nicer labels for speakers
doclab <- paste(docvars(irish_dfm, "name"), docvars(irish_dfm, "party"))
textplot_scale1d(wf, doclabels = doclab)
```

The function also allows to plot scores by a grouping variable, in this case the party affiliation of the speakers.

```{r}
textplot_scale1d(wf, doclabels = doclab, groups = docvars(irish_dfm, "party"))
```

Finally, we can plot the estimated word positions and highlight certain features.

```{r}
textplot_scale1d(wf, margin = "features", 
                 highlighted = c("government", "global", "children", 
                                 "bank", "economy", "the", "citizenship",
                                 "productivity", "deficit"))
```
