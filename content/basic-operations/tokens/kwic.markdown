```r

You can see how keywords are used in the actual contexts in a concordance view produced by `kwic()`. 


```r
immig_kw <- kwic(toks, pattern =  'immig*')
head(immig_kw, 10)
```

```

`kwic()` also takes multiple keywords in a character vector.


```r
immig2_kw <- kwic(toks, pattern = c('immig*', 'migra*'))
head(immig2_kw, 10)
```

With the `window` argument, you can specify the number of words to be displayed around the keyword.


```r
immig2_kw <- kwic(toks, pattern = c('immig*', 'migra*'), window = 7)
head(immig2_kw, 10)
```

```
##

If you want to find multi-word expressions, separate words by whitespace and wrap the character vector by `phrase()`.


```r
asylum_kw <- kwic(toks, pattern = phrase('asylum seeker*'))
head(asylum_kw)
```

```
##

Texts do not always appear nicely in your R console, so you can use `View()` to see the keywords-in-context in an interactive HTML table.


```r
View(immig2_kw)
