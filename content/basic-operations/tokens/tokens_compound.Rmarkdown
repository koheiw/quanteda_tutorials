```{r message=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
```

```{r}
toks <- tokens(data_char_ukimmig2010)
```

There are several multi-word expressions that are important in social scientific reserach.

```{r}
kw_multiword <- kwic(toks, pattern = phrase(c('asylum seeker*', 'british citizen*')))
head(kw_multiword, 10)
```

To preserve these expressions in bag-of-word analysis, you have to compound them using `tokens_compound()`.

```{r}
toks_comp <- tokens_compound(toks, pattern = phrase(c('asylum seeker*', 'british citizen*')))
kw_comp <- kwic(toks_comp, pattern = c('asylum_seeker*', 'british_citizen*'))
head(kw_comp, 10)
```

You can discover muti-words expressions in your tokens using `textstat_collocations()`. See [Compunding multi-word expressions](../../../advanced-operations/compound-mutiword-expressions/) to learn how to do it.
