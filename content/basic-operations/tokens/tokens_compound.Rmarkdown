```{r message=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
```

```{r}
toks <- tokens(data_char_ukimmig2010)
```

There are several multi-word expressions that are important in social scientific reserach.

```{r}
multi_kw <- kwic(toks, pattern = phrase(c('asylum seeker*', 'british citizen*')))
head(multi_kw, 10)
```

To preserve these expressions in bag-of-word analysis, you have to compound them using `tokens_compound()`.

```{r}
comp_toks <- tokens_compound(toks, pattern = phrase(c('asylum seeker*', 'british citizen*')))
compu_kw <- kwic(comp_toks, pattern = c('asylum_seeker*', 'british_citizen*'))
head(compu_kw, 10)
```

You can discover muti-words expressions in your tokens using `textstat_collocations()`. See [Compunding multi-word expressions](../../../advanced-operations/compound-mutiword-expressions/) to learn how to do it.
