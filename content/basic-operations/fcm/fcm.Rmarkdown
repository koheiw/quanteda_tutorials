title: Construct a FCM
weight: 10
draft: false
---

A feature-ouccerances matrix (FCM) records number of co-occurances of tokens. This is a special object in **quanteda**, but behaves similarly to a DFM. 

```{r message=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
require(quanteda.corpora)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
corp <- download('data_corpus_guardian')
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# This code is only for website generation
corp <- readRDS("../../data/data_corpus_guardian.rds")
```

When a corpus is large, you have to select features of a DFM before constructing a FCM.

```{r}
news_dfm <- dfm(corp, remove = stopwords('en'), remove_punct = TRUE)
news_dfm <- dfm_remove(news_dfm, pattern = c('*-time', 'updated-*', 'gmt', 'bst'))
news_dfm <- dfm_trim(news_dfm, min_termfreq = 100)

topfeatures(news_dfm)
nfeat(news_dfm)
```

You can construct a FCM from a DFM or a tokens object using `fcm()`. `topfeatures()` returns the most frequntly co-occuring words.

```{r}
news_fcm <- fcm(news_dfm)
dim(news_fcm)
```

You can select features of a FCM using `fcm_select()`.

```{r}
feat <- names(topfeatures(news_fcm, 50))
news_fcm <- fcm_select(news_fcm, pattern = feat)
dim(news_fcm)
```

A FCM can be used to train word embedding models with the **text2vec** package, or to visualize a semantic network analysis with ` textplot_network()`.

```{r}
size <- log(colSums(dfm_select(news_dfm, feat)))
set.seed(144)
textplot_network(news_fcm, min_freq = 0.8, vertex_size = size / max(size) * 3)
```
